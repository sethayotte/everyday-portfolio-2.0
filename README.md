## Introduction

*With a strong interest in personal investment and finance, I’m interested in developing tools that
can help engage individuals and make their lives easier. Across bank accounts, investment
platforms, budget tools - nothing seems to have a simple, easy-to-digest solution to watch your
performance on a daily basis.*

*While true gains are the culmination of years and decades of time spent in the market, I still like to
see how things are moving day to day - as well as read daily news about earnings, announcements,
etc. Especially in today’s COVID environment, things can swing significantly day to day.*

*The goal of Everyday Portfolio is to give a snapshot of your day in a simple and clean application. I
think this will be a good app to develop alongside the NuCamp curriculum since the ideal
environment would be a native app. Ideally this would be a project that would continue on into the
App Store to give access to everyone.*


## Feature Set

1. “Today View” Dashboard that includes:
      - Total Day Gain/Loss
      - Top 3 Performers (with live price & trend charts)
      - Bottom 3 Performers (with live price & trend charts)
      - Quick access to top news stories

2. "My Positions" view to quickly see all holdings

3. Ability to add new positions after a purchase

4. "Profile" view to manage account


## Development Pipeline

```
Static Webpage  →  Initialize React  →  Migrate to Native Package
```
